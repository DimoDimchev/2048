# 2048

## Project introduction ##

Recently I started playing a modern classic in the area of mobile games 2048 and decided to create a version of it using Python and TKinter. Making the project was just as fun, as playing the game

## Technical stuff ##

The logic of the game is pretty straightforward - it revolves around using multidimensional lists and the TKinter library to visualise the changes, score, etc.

## Bugs and what needs changing ##

Bugs present:
- ~~some of the colors in the ``colors.py`` file can't be loaded~~  - **fixed**
- ~~bugs when making moves later on in the game~~  - **fixed**
- ~~random freezes and crashes~~  - **mostly fixed**


Areas that can be improved:
- there aren't any animations invloved so the game feels a bit bland (and so I'm thinking of transitioning the project to JavaScript)
- The beforementioned bugs make the game frustrating sometimes
